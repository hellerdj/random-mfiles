function [spi, vpi, sni, vni] = get_unit_evals(uname, pcoh)% get_unit_evals returns 4 vectors, the interpolated responses and% variance for the desired vector of coherences, pcoh.% Interpolation of spikes, spi and sni, are by spline using the % original pcoh vals and measured response.% Interpolated variances assume that var is a function of spikes, % so use the interpolated spikes to perfrom a spline interpolation on% var(raw spikes). The unit must have extension .mat; but .mat is not sent.%unameload "uname" % raw coherences valscoh = uname(:,1)'% raw pref responsessp = uname(:,2)'spi = spline(coh,sp,pcoh)sn = uname(:,4)'sni = spline(coh,sn,pcoh)vp = uname(:,3)'vpi = spline(sp,vp,spi)vn = uname(:,5)'vni = spline(sn,vn,sni)
