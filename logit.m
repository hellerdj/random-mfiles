function y = logit(p)% logit(p) returns log(p/(1-p))% p can be a vector or a matrix% useful for logistic regression.% recall that p = exp(logit(p)) / (1+ exp(logit(p)))% 1/29/98 mns wrote ity = real(log(p ./ (1-p)));% I'm not sure the 'real' part was necessary, but there were situations% encounterd in which matlab returned complex vals (the imag part was 0).  I% have yet to understand why.
