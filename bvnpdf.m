function p = bvnpdf(x,y)% function p = bvnpdf(x,y) computes the bivariate normal prob density% function at point x,y.  This function is written so as to interface% with dblquad for numerical integration.  % The means and covariance are passed as global parameters. % See mvnpdf for the general version of the multivariate normal pdf.% 4/5/99 mns wrote itglobal muglobal Cp = repmat(0,size(x));for i = 1:length(x)  z = [x(i) y]';  dim = 2;  p(i) = ((2*pi)^(-.5*dim) / sqrt(det(C))) ...      * exp(-.5 * (z - mu)' * inv(C) *  (z - mu))';end
