function [val] = get7000cd(e0,cd8000,ref7000)%  [val] = get7000cd(e0,cd8000,ref7000) gets identifying codes from%  snippet of ecodes which use the 8000+ 7000+ref+ logic.   %  e0 is the snippet of ecode, which is n by 2 (1st%      column contains ecodes), %  cd8000 is the 8000+ number that is dropped%     before the value of interest (defined in the *.d files as I_FIXXCD for%     example) and the %  ref7000 number refers to the value that is subtracted%    away to reveal the value you want.  In most cases, the value of interest%    is added to 7500.% e.g.,% get7000cd(602,e0,I_STDIACD,7500) returns the diameter in 10ths of degrees.% 8/1/97 jdr & mns wrote itq = find(e0(:,1) == cd8000);if length(q) ~= 1  error('get7000cd: 8000 code not found, or found multiply')else  rows = find(e0(:,1) >= 7000 & e0(:,1)<8000);  L = rows > q;  val = e0(min(rows(L)),1) - ref7000;  end
