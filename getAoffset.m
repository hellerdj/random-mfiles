function [aoff] = getAoffset(e0)% getAoffset(e0) looks at an efile snippet and returns the offset in bytes% into the Afile.  An efile snippet is an n by 2 matrix (the 2nd and third% columns of the e-matrix returned by getEfile.m) containing ecode and% time.  For A-file index events, the columns contain a negative event code% and an A-file offset.  If the snippet does not contain a -112 code, then% the function returns NaN.% 8/4/97 mns wrote itq = find(e0(:,1) == -112);if isscalar(q)  aoff = e0(q,2);else  aoff = nan;end
