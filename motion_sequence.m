function y = motion_sequence(x,dx,dt,nsteps)% motion_sequence builds a large matrix out of x by%		copying it nsteps times. The result is built as the sum of% 	x with itself offset by dx columns and dt rows.%		This is done as many times as there are specified steps.%	 Notice that if dx and/or dt are >= corresponding dimensions%		of x, then x is simply stamped copied at new locations.%		As a motion sequence, think of x as a local xt function or%		flash. Usage: y = motion_sequence(x,dx,dt,nsteps)[n,m] = size(x);y = zeros(n + dt * nsteps-1, m + dx * nsteps-1);for i = 0:nsteps-1		n0 = 1 + i*dt;		m0 = 1 + i*dx;		z = y(n0:n0+n-1, m0:m0+m-1);  y(n0:n0+n-1, m0:m0+m-1) = x + z;end
